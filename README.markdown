This is my copy of a a Turing School repo for practicing data structures in javascript.

## Data Structures & Algorithms

In the process of becoming or practicing as a web application developer, it's easy to lose sight of Computer Science.

This collection of exercises and experiments seeks to help you build an understanding of those foundations.

## Local Setup

- Fork this repo
- Clone your forked repo
- `cd data_structures_and_algorithms`
- Set the remote
  - `git remote add upstream https://github.com/turingschool/data_structures_and_algorithms.git`

If there have been changes to this main repo - you can pull them down in the following way

- Make sure you are on a master branch, with no uncommitted work (makes this easier)
- `git fetch upstream master`
